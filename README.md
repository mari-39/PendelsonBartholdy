# PendelssonBartholdy
This project was developed as part of a practical computer science module.
It provides an easy implementation of constraint-based particle physics.

## Features
- Particlemovement using Verletintegration
- An Abstraction for Collisions
  - Distanceconstraint between two particles
  - Distanceconstraint between particle and point
  - Collisionconstraint between particles
  - BoxConstraint for particle to stay in a box
  - Angleconstraint that doesn't work (and never will)
- Simple UI
- Five different scenes
